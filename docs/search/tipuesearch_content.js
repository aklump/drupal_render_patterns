var tipuesearch = {"pages":[{"title":"Changelog","text":"  [4.0.0] - 2021-10-04  Added   Standard namespaces so core auto-loading is used.   Changed   Pattern classes should now be namespaced to their extension, like other classes.  For example of your theme foo_theme is providing classes they should be namespaced to Drupal\\foo_theme\\RenderPatterns\\.  They should be saved to foo_theme\/src\/RenderPatterns\/.  The same is true for modules that provide render pattern(s).   Removed   render_patterns_get hook_render_patterns_info hook_render_patterns_info_alter \\Drupal\\render_patterns\\Uncacheable   [8.x-3.0] - 2021-03-29  Added   Pattern classes should be declared final. The ::get() method to replace render_patterns_get(). Invalidate \\Drupal::cache('bootstrap')-&gt;get('render_patterns_list') when default theme changes. Composer-based dependencies. See README.md for adding to your app-level composer.json for dependencies.   Changed   It is no longer necessary to call parent::__construct() when using \\Drupal\\Core\\DependencyInjection\\ContainerInjectionInterface in your patterns. Testing a pattern property with isset() will now return FALSE if the overridden value is NULL. Moved default theme render patterns directory from {theme}\/render_patterns to {theme}\/src\/render_patterns\/   Removed   ::cl() has been removed. Try \\Drupal\\front_end_components\\BemTrait instead. ::ajaxWrap() ::getForm() ::defaults() ::render() has been remove. Use the render service after ::build().   Deprecated   $this-&gt;properties. You should migrate to ::getProperties(). render_patterns_get(). You should call ::get on the pattern class itself.   [8.x-2.1] - 2021-03-26  Added   Support for validation of objects by FQN. See docs for usage example.   [8.x-2.0] - 2020-02-14  Changed   Switched to semantic versioning.   Removed   Dependency on drupal:data_api. See documentation update-v2.md on how to handle this breaking change.   8.x-1.1-rc1 2019-03-15T16:16, aklump   You must declare all properties as protected or in the schema. Change all your patterns to extend \\Drupal\\my_theme\\RenderPatterns\\ instead of RenderPatternsPattern. You must add the PHP 7 typehints for: build and render per \\Drupal\\my_theme\\RenderPatterns\\Interface. It is no longer recommended to suffix your classes with RenderPattern. You may now pass an array of values as the second argument to render_patterns_get to set those properties on instantiation. public static defaults() has been deprecated. You should migrate to class::$properties. Added JSONSchema validation via Pattern::$properties. Use it to define the property schema per JSON Schema format for automatic validation.   7.x-1.1-rc5   BREAKING CHANGE: defaults() should now be a public static function.

You expose only the dynamic elements of your render array as class properties, and the rest of the render array is hidden within the black box of the render pattern class.  This type of design makes sense if you need to reference the same render array in more than one place as it avoids errors caused by code duplication.  It comes from the DRY principle.  You may also visit the project page on Drupal.org.  Installation   Download this module to web\/modules\/custom\/render_patterns. Add the following to the application's composer.json above web root.  {   \"repositories\": [     {       \"type\": \"path\",       \"url\": \"web\/modules\/custom\/render_patterns\"     }   ] }  Now run composer require drupal\/render-patterns Enable this module. Begin creating one or more render patterns in {active theme}\/src\/RenderPatterns\/.  (You may also provide classes in a module by adjusting the namespace to the module.) Use namespace \\Drupal\\my_theme\\src\\RenderPatterns for the classes.   Usage  Pattern Properties  The \"render pattern\" is meant to encapsulate common render array situations. The pattern is a class with a build() method. As shown immediately below, nothing changes across implementations. This may not always be practical, so...  namespace Drupal\\my_theme\\RenderPatterns;  final MyReuseablePattern extends \\Drupal\\render_patterns\\Pattern {    public function build(): array {     return ['#markup' =&gt; 'I am reusable text.'];   }    ...  }   ...the interface defines the getProperties method, which exposes any number of configurable properties that will influence the build. This method returns an array of property names, each defining itself with the following keys: type, default, alter.  protected function getProperties(): array {   return [     'account' =&gt; [        \/\/ This must be an instance of this class.       'type' =&gt; \\Drupal\\Core\\Session\\AccountInterface::class,        \/\/ If the value is NULL, ::default() will be called.  This will only be       \/\/ called if the value is NULL, so generally speaking this is called       \/\/ once.  Note that any callable can be used so you do NOT need to use       \/\/ an anonymous function here, but instead could reference a method on       \/\/ this class or elsewhere; and the callback receives the property name       \/\/ as the argument.       'default' =&gt; function () {         return $this-&gt;currentUser;       },        \/\/ This optional key can be used to modify the value before it's returned       \/\/ by the magic getter.  This is always called, each time the code calls       \/\/ $this-&gt;account.       'alter' =&gt; function ($value, $default, $is_overridden) {         \/\/ TODO You may do something here to alter the property value.       },     ],      \/\/ In this example you see that two types entities are allowed.     'entity' =&gt; [       'type' =&gt; [         \\Drupal\\node\\NodeInterface::class,         \\Drupal\\user\\UserInterface::class,       ],     ],      \/\/ And then here we have some basic types.     'collectionId' =&gt; [        \/\/ Both integers and nulls can be set on this key.       'type' =&gt; ['integer', 'null'],       'default' =&gt; 10,     ],      \/\/ Just a simple array.     'ajaxContext' =&gt; ['type' =&gt; 'array'],   ]; }   Building The Render Array  Most often you will follow this simple pattern:  $renderable_array = \\Drupal\\my_theme\\RenderPatterns\\MyReuseablePattern::get([   'entity' =&gt; $account,   'ajaxContext' =&gt; ['foo' =&gt; 'bar'], ])-&gt;build(); $html = \\Drupal::service('renderer')-&gt;render($renderable_array);   Instance Property Modification  For more complete situations you have the ability to modify properties on an instance if you do something like this:  $pattern = \\Drupal\\my_theme\\RenderPatterns\\MyReuseablePattern::get([   'entity' =&gt; $account,   'ajaxContext' =&gt; ['foo' =&gt; 'bar'], ]);  $pattern-&gt;entity = $node;  $renderable_array = $pattern-&gt;build(); ...   Property Validation  Property values will be validated against the schema defined by getProperties() and \\Drupal\\my_theme\\RenderPatterns\\Exception will be thrown if the value falls outside of the allowed type. Validation uses JSON Schema, which receives a schema built from getProperties() with a few, minor modifications for compatibility with Drupal.
